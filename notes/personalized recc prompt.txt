1. User’s Own Most-Ordered Items (Personal History)
The system first checks what you (the current user) have ordered most often in the selected category.
These items are sorted by how many times you’ve ordered them (most ordered first).
These are added to the recommendations list first (up to 5).
2. Collaborative Filtering (ML: Nearest Neighbors)
If there are still fewer than 5 recommendations, the system uses collaborative filtering:
It builds a matrix of all users and their order counts for each item in the category.
It uses the NearestNeighbors algorithm to find the 3 users most similar to you (based on your order history in that category).
It recommends items that these similar users have ordered, but you have not, and that you haven’t marked as “not interested.”
These ML-based recommendations are added next (avoiding duplicates and “not interested” items).
3. Most Popular Items (All Users)
If there are still fewer than 5 recommendations, the system looks at the most popular items in the category (by all users, sorted by total order count).
It adds these to your recommendations, skipping any already recommended or “not interested.”
4. Random Items (Fallback)
If there are still fewer than 5, the system randomly selects items from the category (again, skipping already recommended and “not interested” items) to fill up to 5.
5. Exclusions
Any item you have marked as “not interested” is excluded from all recommendation steps.
No duplicate items are shown.
6. Display
Only the top 5 recommendations are shown in the UI for each category.
Each recommended item has a “Not interested?” button so you can further personalize your recommendations.
